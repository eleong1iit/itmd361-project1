	<p><strong>You are what you eat!</strong> That's what my mom has told me since I was a young child. I value what goes inside my body. Eating the right diet positively affects our overall health, mood, energy levels, and sleep quality. I've tried many diets, but you don't need to follow a specific plan to eat right. Eating the right amounts of fats, carbohydrates, proteins, vitamins, and minerals has helped me stay at the top of my game.</p>
