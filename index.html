	<p>Hi! My name is Edmund Leong, and I am a junior high school student attending William Jones College Preparatory High School in Chicago, Illinois. I am currently studying ITMD 361 at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT).</p>
	<h2>Academics</h2>
	<p>I am currently taking 3 Advanced Placement (AP) classes at my school: AP Biology, AP Calculus BC, and AP Computer Science A. I took AP Chemistry as a sophomore. I'm interested in applying STEM to human social behavior, which is why I want to take AP Psychology next year. Although I am learning a diverse wealth of knowledge, I want to study physics at college and work in financial technology.</p>

	<ul>
	  <li>Build websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</li>
	  <li>Debug and proofread other people's websites</li>
	  <li>Publish websites via GitHub repositories</li>
	  <li>Create a personal website</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Academic Goals</h2>
	<p>By the end of the 2020-2021 school year, I will be able to:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Answer questions about introductory biology, single-variable calculus, and Java programming.</li>
	  <li>Apply time management and leadership skills to my interests outside of the classroom.</li>
	  <li>Write a college admissions essay worthy of acceptance.</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Non-Academic Goals</h2>
