	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p>Hi! My name is Edmund Leong, and I am a junior high school student attending William Jones College Preparatory High School in Chicago, Illinois. I am currently studying ITMD 361 at Illinois Institute of Technology (IIT).</p>
	<h2>Academics</h2>
	<p>I am currently taking 3 Advanced Placement (AP) classes at my school: AP Biology, AP Calculus BC, and AP Computer Science A. I took AP Chemistry as a sophomore. I'm interested in applying STEM to human social behavior, which is why I want to take AP Psychology next year. Although I am learning a diverse wealth of knowledge, I want to study physics at college and work in financial technology.</p>
